# Welcome to The World of Programming

### Introduction 
Hello, I am Siddharth Singh, I am currently studying in class 11th in Scottish High International School in Gurgaon, India.
My interest in computers was from starting, so I took Computer Science in 10th class. In early days, I was very happy studying it but as soon as we got deeper into the subject and our school started taking exams, I got really frustrated and also scored very less marks(36/100). But one day(13th March, 2017), I had my Chemistry exam the next day but I was on Youtube watching videos. Suddenly a video came abut making Snakes Game by Daniel Shiffmann. When I watched the video, I was really fascinated by hias way of teaching and I started learning programming from him. This started increasing my interest in the subject. Even my marks started increasing from (36/100) to (89/100) which was a huge leap. I started learning other languages too. I started watching more coding videos. 
Now my favourite Youtubers are as follows:
Daniel Shiffmann(Javascript, Java)
Siraj Raval(Machine Learning)
Brian Voong(IOS Development)
And Many More
